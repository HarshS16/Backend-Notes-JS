// In backend developement we need to master 2 things: one is a programming language which in our case is javascript and the other is database which could me sql, mongodb, nosql, postgresql.

// The basic logic of backend is that we have a database in which we store all the data, information 
// We have a code in the backend which handles all the responses and does the fetching(post,get,delete) from the database
// APIs are used to commmunicate between the browser and the backend code

// files and directory structure 
1) Package.json- manages all the packages
2) .env- contains the environment variables
3) src folder: contains index file for the basic structure and connecting to the database ,
